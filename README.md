# 📝 Checklist Tracker

A basic to-do checklist you can run right in your browser! No accounts, no databases, no fancy setups — just open the file and start tracking tasks. Everything saves locally in your browser.

## 🔧 What It Does

* Add new tasks
* Check off tasks when you're done
* Add subtasks under any task
* Edit subtask names
* Save everything automatically with `localStorage`
* Toggle the visibility of subtasks
* Simple and clean dark mode design using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download or clone this repo**
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. That’s it! Start checking things off your list ✅

## 📁 Files

* `index.html`: The entire app lives in this one file (HTML, CSS via Tailwind CDN, and JavaScript).
* No frameworks, no builds, just plain code.

## 💾 How it Saves

All your tasks and subtasks are stored using `localStorage`. That means they’re saved in your browser — nothing gets uploaded or shared.

> Note: If you clear your browser data, the tasks will be gone.

## 🎯 Future Ideas (if I ever get to it)

* Drag-and-drop reordering
* Task deadlines or reminders
* Light/dark theme toggle
* Mobile improvements
